# Getting Started

- `git clone git@github.com:wooga/Pocket-Island.git`

- Get the art assets from http://cdn-mkt.wooga.com/downloads/images.zip and extract them into ./Pocket-Island/images.

- Run `rake` to generate all config files, sprite images, etc.

- Run a HTTP server: You can for example use the SimpleHTTPServer module of python and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` on the command line.

- Finally, open http://0.0.0.0:8000/ipad.html to play the game (preferably in Chrome or Safari). 

- Or use http://0.0.0.0:8000/fullscreen.html to play fullscreen.

## Rake tasks

- `rake all` : Build project. Copies final files to build/
- `rake check_missing_files` : List files that are referenced by the game, but don't exist
- `rake clean` : Remove any temp file.
- `rake clobber` : Remove any generated file.
- `rake default` : what does it do?
- `rake lint` : Run jslint
- `rake list_extra_files` : List files that are not referenced by the game but are in the project
- `rake remove_trailing_spaces` : Remove trailing spaces


### Adding new sprites

Start with creating a ``.sprite`` file that lists individual images
that should be included in the sprite. Then run:

    rake sprite_name.png

to generate the image based on ``sprite_name.sprite`` file.
An image and ``sprite_name.json`` will be generated.
Use the value from the json file to update ``entities.json`` with
``width``, ``height``, ``spritey`` and ``offsetY`` values.
Remember to divide pixel values by 48 before entering them in ``entities.json``.
